How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Finding in specific lines of code instead of search in all the file(s) content.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    Making sure what have been done, or revert to previews code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    You control your changes.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To give you the ability keep track of changes for the different elements of files you need for a web site/app/

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log -p "file name"

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you know exactly what was the change, and can rollback.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A simple web site to test.
